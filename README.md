Silver Jacket is a small mod I did for my COMP-SCI capstone project. It mainly focuses on adding passives that interact with status effects and guns + actives with interesting mechanics.

The mod has:

- 5 Passives

- 3 Actives

- 9 Guns

This mod also features a very basic form of stat tracking. The mod stores each time you've picked up a gun or item from this mod. You can read these stats with the command "slvjckt read_stats". These stats are saved only on your computer and won't be shared with anyone else.
